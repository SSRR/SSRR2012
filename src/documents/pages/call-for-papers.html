<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<h2>IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics
Nov. 5-8, 2012</h2>
<h2>(Nov 9, 2012 Field Exercise on Casualty Care and Evacuation)</h2>

<h3>Theme: 10 Years and Beyond!</h3>

<p>The 10th anniversary of the IEEE International Symposium on Safety,
Security, and Rescue Robotics with continue its tradition of
attracting cutting-edge papers in the theory and practice of robots
for rapid and secure inspection of critical infrastructure, travelers,
luggage, and paces; disaster response and recovery; humanitarian
demining, disaster mitigation and recovery; detection of chemical,
biological and radiological risks and operations in these dangerous
sites; etc</p>

<p>SSRR 2012 will also serve as an entry point for researchers and
technologists who want to learn more about SSR robotics, through
tutorials and keynotes including
<ol>
  <ul>Dr. Gill Pratt, DARPA Grand Robotics Challenge</ul>
  <ul>Dr. Richard Voyles, NSF National Robotics Initiative</ul>
  <ul>Prof. Hajime Asama, University of Tokyo, Nuclear Decommissioning</ul>
  <ul>Prof. Satoshi Tadokoro, Tohoku University, Retrospective of RoboCup
Rescue Contributions</ul>
</ol>
The conference is co-located with Disaster CityÂ® and will host
demonstrations organized around challenge problems (TBD), plan to
bring your robots!

Papers and participation fall into: 
- regular papers (4-6 pages) that describe original work in SSR or
work that can be applied to SSR domains
- center/project papers (2-4 pages) that describe work at centers or
active multi-institutional projects 
- Outrageous Visions for Computing papers (2-4) that present long-term
challenges or new ideas outside of the mainstream in computing for SSR
robotics

Topics include but are not limited to:
Biologically inspired solutions
Casualty assessment, care and extraction
Chemical, biological, or radiological events
Computer vision
GPS-denied navigation and mapping
Humanoid robots
Humanitarian demining
Human-robot interaction
Inspection of critical infrastructure
Manipulation
Multi-agent coordination
Nuclear decommissioning
Sensing and sensor fusion
SLAM in extreme environments
Structural assessment
Telemedicine
Unmanned ground, aerial, and marine vehicles
Urban search and rescue 
Wildland fire fighting

In addition, SSRR 2012 encourages the submission of "non-traditional"
papers which contribute to understanding robot systems for Public
Safety but may not have results in a Public Safety domain. 

SSRR 2012 will have four paper awards:
Best Paper Award
Best Student Paper Award
Best Non-Traditional Robotics Paper Award
Outrageous Visions for Computing in SSRR

Important Dates:

Jul 30 Submission of proposals for tutorials, special sessions
Aug 15 Submission of regular papers, center/project papers, and
visioning papers
Oct 1 Notification of acceptance
Oct 1 Submission of 2 page Late Breaking Reports
Oct 22 Submission of final papers
